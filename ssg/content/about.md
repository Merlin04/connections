## Info

The Connections is a replacement for the sadly dead missed connections, may they rest in peace. Never forget admin's bullshit, long live student body autonomy.

#### The Commandments of the Connections

0. **Thou shalt act in good faith**
1. **Thou shalt not drop names nor personally identifiable information.**
2. **Thou shalt always seek to speak in a manner which is deescalatory.**
3. **Thou shalt not post anything which risks getting our asses subpoena'd.**
4. **Thou shalt not attempt to post images including genitalia, any form of sexual intercourse, or anything else which might scar our dear editor.**
5. **Thou shalt not use shame as a weapon of conformity or reform.**

Additionally, we cannot gaurantee that your posts will stay private to this website, as we realistically cannot stop users from sharing posts publicly.

You may submit to the Connections anonymously by emailing <a href="mailto:submit@reedconnections.org">submit@reedconnections.org</a> or non-anonymously by emailing <a href="mailto:submit+notanon@reedconnections.org">submit+notanon@reedconnections.org</a>.
